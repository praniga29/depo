# Real-Time Bus Tracking System with Passenger Alerts

## Project Overview
This project is a **Real-Time Bus Tracking System** designed to provide passengers with real-time updates on bus locations and arrival times. The mobile app is integrated with a notification feature that alerts passengers through phone vibrations when the bus is approaching their stop.

## Features
- **Real-time bus tracking**: Displays the current position of buses on a map, highlighting their routes.
- **Bus route maps**: Shows the bus route, stops, and expected arrival times.
- **Passenger alerts**: Sends phone vibration alerts when the bus is near the selected stop.
- **Interactive map**: Displays nearby bus stops, allows users to monitor the busâ€™s real-time progress.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: 
  - Figma (for design prototyping)
  - React Native (for mobile app development)
- **Backend**: 
  - Node.js 
  - Express.js
- **Real-time data**: 
  - Firebase or WebSocket API (for live bus location updates)
- **Mapping API**: 
  - Google Maps API or Mapbox (for real-time route and location visualization)

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/bus-tracking-system.git
   Navigate to the project directory.
Install dependencies:
Copy code
npm install
Start the backend server:
arduino
Copy code
npm run start
Open the mobile app in an emulator or physical device to see the real-time bus tracking functionality.
Usage
Launch the mobile app and select a bus route.
The map will display the current location of the bus, and a highlighted route showing the path to the next stop.
When the bus is near the selected stop, the app will vibrate to notify the passenger.
Future Enhancements
Adding push notifications to complement phone vibrations.
Integrating a fare management system for contactless payments.
Providing real-time congestion data on the bus to passengers.
